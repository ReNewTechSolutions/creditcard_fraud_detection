ðŸ“Œ Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
Project Overview
Developed by ReNewTech Solutions, this project applies Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

Highly imbalanced dataset (fraud â‰ˆ 0.17% of transactions)

Models evaluated:

Using all 30 original features

Using top 6 features most correlated with fraud

Metrics:

Accuracy

ROC-AUC Score

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Project Structure
README.md â€” Project overview and documentation

Dataset
Source: Credit Card Fraud Detection (Kaggle)

Real-world European card transactions

Strong class imbalance (fraud is rare)

Machine Learning Models
Decision Tree Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM) â€” LinearSVC

Both models evaluated:

On all features

On the top 6 features identified via Pearson correlation

Enhancements Beyond IBM Course
While inspired by the IBM Developer Skills Network (Machine Learning with Python specialization), this project by ReNewTech Solutions adds:

Feature selection using correlation analysis

Reduced-feature model training and evaluation

Clean separation of training scripts for modularity

ROC curve visualizations

Structured project organization for real-world deployment
